I'm a third year graduate student at [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn). My research interests span robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, vision-language models, reinforcement learning, and generative AI. I am currently looking for PhD positions in robotics and embodied intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prog. Yiran Shen](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/shenyiran/zh_CN/index.htm) of IGIP Lab from [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn)
